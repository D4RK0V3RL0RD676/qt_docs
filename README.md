# Qt Docs
Python scripts for downloading minimal versions of the docs for Qt

### Usage:
 * run `download.py` to download and minify all the files in `files.txt` (takes forever)
 * run `search.py` to search through all downloaded files to map out and update `files.txt`
 * files listed in `404.txt` are broken links
